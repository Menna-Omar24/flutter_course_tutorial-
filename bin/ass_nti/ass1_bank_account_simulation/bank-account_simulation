Task 1: Bank Account Simulation with Profit Prediction
Task Description:

Create a console program to manage a single bank account. The program should allow the user to:

    Create an account by entering their name, account number, account type (savings or checking), and initial balance.

    Perform deposits and withdrawals with input validation.

    Predict the future balance based on a profit-sharing model.

    View the account summary showing all details.

Menu Options:

1. Deposit
2. Withdraw
3. Predict Future Balance (Profit Model)
4. View Account Summary
5. Exit

Details and Examples for Each Option:
1. Deposit

    Add money to the account balance. Reject negative amounts.

Example:

Choose an option: 1
Enter amount to deposit: 500
Deposit successful. New balance: $2000.50

Choose an option: 1
Enter amount to deposit: -100
Invalid amount. Deposit failed.

2. Withdraw

    Subtract money from the balance if sufficient funds are available. Reject negative amounts.

Example:

Choose an option: 2
Enter amount to withdraw: 300
Withdrawal successful. New balance: $1700.50

Choose an option: 2
Enter amount to withdraw: 2000
Insufficient balance. Withdrawal denied.

Choose an option: 2
Enter amount to withdraw: -50
Invalid amount. Withdrawal failed.

3. Predict Future Balance (Profit Model)

    Ask for the number of years (integer).

    Ask for the annual profit rate (percentage).

    Calculate the future balance using the formula:
    Future Balance=Current Balance×(1+Profit Rate×Years)
    Future Balance=Current Balance×(1+Profit Rate×Years)

    Display the predicted future balance (double) and the rounded balance as an integer.

Example:

Choose an option: 3
Enter number of years: 3
Enter annual profit rate (%): 6

Predicted future balance after 3 years: $2031.54
Rounded balance: $2031

4. View Account Summary

    Display the name, account number, account type, and current balance (both as double and integer).

Example:

Choose an option: 4

Account Summary:
Name: Ahmed Khan
Account Number: 123456
Account Type: savings
Current Balance: $1700.50
Rounded Balance: $1700

5. Exit

    End the program.

Input Validation:

    Reject invalid account types (only "savings" or "checking" allowed).

    Reject negative amounts for deposits and withdrawals.

    Prevent withdrawals that exceed the current balance.

    Number of years and profit rate must be zero or positive.
