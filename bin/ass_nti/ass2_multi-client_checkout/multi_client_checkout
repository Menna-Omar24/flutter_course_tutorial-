üõí Task 2: Multi-Client Checkout System
üìã Business Rules:

    The store offers 5 fixed products:

    1. Keyboard - $100
    2. Mouse - $50
    3. Monitor - $300
    4. USB Cable - $20
    5. Headphones - $150

    For each client:

        The customer chooses products by number and quantity until done (enter 0).

        The program then asks for the client‚Äôs name and phone number.

        Calculates subtotal, tax, discount, and delivery fee (if any).

        Shows a detailed receipt.

    After finishing one client‚Äôs order, the program resets and allows the next client to start shopping.

    This continues until the program is manually stopped (or you can add an option to quit).

üßæ Example for One Client:

Customer input:

    Product 3 (Monitor), quantity 2

    Product 2 (Mouse), quantity 1

    Done shopping (enter 0)

    Client enters name: John Doe

    Client enters phone: 123-456-7890

    Wants delivery

Notes:

    After finishing one client‚Äôs transaction and showing the summary, the program should clear any stored totals and start fresh for the next customer.

    This simulates a real store checkout system handling multiple customers one after another.

Functions to Implement (suggested):

function showMenu()
function calculateTax()
